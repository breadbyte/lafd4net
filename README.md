# lafd4net

A port of [light-anime-face-detector](https://github.com/cheese-roll/light-anime-face-detector) to .NET 5.0, which is based on [LFFD, a Light and Fast Face Detector for Edge Devices](https://github.com/YonghaoHe/LFFD-A-Light-and-Fast-Face-Detector-for-Edge-Devices) [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10633)

## Usage
1. Get models from https://github.com/cheese-roll/light-anime-face-detector/
2. Refer to the LAFDTest project for a demo.

## Issues
Detection is a bit iffy at times.

If you find an image that this library does not detect that [lafd](https://github.com/cheese-roll/light-anime-face-detector) does detect, open an issue about it!

### This is an extremely experimental library!
Use at your own risk!
